"""Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of
all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number
that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because
26 / 13 has no remainder.)"""

    if num%x == 0: # seeing if our max number can divide all other numbers in our range
